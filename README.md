# TSP
This is another student project.  This one was about the travelling salesman problem.  There is code to search for paths using brute force, a greedy algorithm, a monte carlo method, and an ant system.  Code for the ant system is based off of the code from [Clever Algorithms: Nature-Inspired Programming Recipes.](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/swarm/ant_system.html)

##Building and running

[Install Cargo and Rust if you don't have them.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

Take a look at `src/main.rs` and uncomment functions in the main loop, if you want.  Parts A, B, C, and D run tests to compare the performance of different algorithms.  They will take a while to run.

You can run the project with `cargo run`.
